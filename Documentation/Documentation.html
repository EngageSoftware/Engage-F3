    <h1>DotNetNuke F3 Module</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Congratulations! You have created your own DotNetNuke Module.&nbsp; Please
        take a few minutes to read this document, which will help you install and configure
        your new module.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>* Important *</h2>
    <p>Due to limitations in the templating capabilities of Visual Studio, you will need to make some minor changes before you can build this module.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Edit the Project properties by double-cliking on the My Project folder in Solution Explorer.</li>
        <li>Make sure that the Application Tab is selected</li>
        <li>Make sure the Root Namespace text-box is empty, and save the Project.</li>
    </ul>
    This module is configured to reference the DotNetNuke Library project rather than the assembly in the /bin folder.  If you do not have
    the DotNetNuke Library project in your solution, you can change the reference in the References tab of the Project Properties.  Select the
    DotNetNuke Library reference, and click Remove.  Then click Add and find the DotNetNuke.dll assembly in the File Dialog.
